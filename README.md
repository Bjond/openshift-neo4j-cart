openshift-neo4j-cart
====================

Bj√∂nd Systems Inc.

Embeddable OpenShift cartridge for the Neo4j graph database.

HA mode but single instance (core) implementation.

Can run embedded in non-scaling mode and as a service (separate gear) in scaling mode.

This implementation does not scale and has a Min-Max == 1.

I'm not sufficiently fly with Openshift to create a clustered scalable gear.
